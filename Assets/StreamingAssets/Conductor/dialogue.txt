Conductor: “You may keep it. Or you may give it. Both are choices.”

Skellie: “I’ve kept enough.”

Skellie gives the flower

Conductor: “Thank you. The last of your kindness fits here.”

Skellie:“On this line I met a knight who needed warmth and a push. A scholar who needed the last page. Two raccoons who needed a joke and a light. A mother who needed a receipt with love on it.
***
A teacher who needed the bold note. …and a lifeguard who needed to forgive herself before she could go.”
***
Conductor (soft): “You listened.”
***
Skellie: “I think I knew them all already. That’s the trick of it, isn’t it? They were my best friend, my doctor, my siblings, my mom, my teacher…and the girl who didn’t know how to stand near me without being loud.”
***
Conductor: “This carriage carries unfinished business. Yours. Theirs. And mine.”
***
Skellie: “You didn’t show up much. But you still built the tracks.”
***
There is a long pause.
***
Conductor: “I laid rails I did not ride.”
***
Skellie: “And I kept saying I was fine. It was easier than being honest. I thought there’d be time to… I don’t know… talk without flinching.”
***
Conductor: “Passengers say ‘later’ to avoid ‘now.’ Then the platform arrives without their permission.”
***
Skellie (a breath; accepting): “I think I know what this train is. It’s my last good minute. Or the last good shape of me.
***
All these cars, so I could try again to be kind. To move people. So I could be moved, too.”
***
Conductor turns toward Skellie.
***
Conductor: “Second chances don’t fix the past.  They change what you take with you.”
***
Skellie (quiet): “I wanted… one more soda with him. A check-in I wouldn’t miss. A joke with them.
***
A night she didn’t have to work so hard. A class I wouldn’t skip. Another chance to see her again .”
***
Conductor: “Name one thing you will keep.”
