Skellie: “I’m at least… stumbulatory.”

Skellie: “Name that doubles as a diagnosis. Efficient.”

Mort: “Efficiency is kinder than people think.”

Mort: “I graded outcomes. And I keep revising a final that will not change.”

Mort: “Someone I would keep trying to—even when trying was over.”

Skellie asks: “What would help?”
