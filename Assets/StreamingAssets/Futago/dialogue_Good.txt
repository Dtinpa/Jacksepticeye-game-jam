Haru: “Heh. Okay, okay—joke first, truth second. We can look.”
***
Natsu: “We can peek under the coat now.”
***
Skellie: “If it’s scary, we blink at the same time.”
***
Haru: “Synchronized bravery!”
***
Natsu: “We practiced in the trash behind the bakery.”
***
Haru (softening): “If we cry, it’s a prank.”
***
Natsu (aside): “It’s not.”
***
There is a moment of pause.
***
Haru: “He’s gone, huh?”
***
Natsu: “Seems so.”
***
Skellie: “I don’t think you two really needed me.”
***
Both: “Don’t say that! You’re our friend now!”
***
Futago stands up to leave as the train slows to a stop.
***
They wobble, separate for a beat (the coat sags), then re-stack with a salute.
***
Haru (Departure): “Thanks, Captain Bones.”
***
Natsu (Departure): “We’ll keep the light on.”
***
Haru (Departure): “Stay cool, you beautiful dreamer you.”
***
Skellie: “Uh.. thanks?”
***
They scoot down the aisle, the trench coat swishing.
***
Something cool and glinting is left on the seat. <stop>
