Kyoko (cheerful hum, hands busy): “Welcome! Sit anywhere—oh, you’re standing. Efficient!”
***
Skellie: “I’m mostly bones. Very stackable.”
***
Kyoko (soft laugh): “You’re polite. My favorite kind of customer.”
***
Skellie: “You seem… very busy.”
***
Kyoko (voice quickens): “Only a little. Menu’s simple: apologies, leftovers, and coffee that never cools—if I keep pouring.”
***
Skellie: “How long have you been pouring?”
***
Kyoko (slows): “Since I missed the chance to say ‘I’m sorry’ for being so busy while it still mattered.”
***
Skellie: “You can still say it. Even if they can’t hear you in this place.”
***
Kyoko (tiny smile): “Maybe it’ll make me feel better..”
***
Skellie asks: “Is that what do you need?”
***
Kyoko: “A proper check close. But with a compliment and a tip.”
***
Skellie: “I can give you a receipt and a hug?”
***
Kyoko (smiling): “If you have time for both.”<stop>
